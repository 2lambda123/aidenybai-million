# Automatic Mode

Automatic mode is the default mode of Million.js. It automatically converts React components to Million.js components and makes them faster without you having tweak a lot of your code.


If you remember from [Installation](/docs/install) when you set up Million in your project, you probably used automatic mode which is what we recommend for most users. There you simply passed the `auto` option to the compiler.

In this part of the docs, we expatiate more on more things you can do with automatic mode and how you can properly configure it to your taste.

### Advanced customization

Automatic mode provides options to tune it to your taste:

- `threshold`: The threshold for the heuristic to determine whether a component should be converted to Million.js. The greater the threshold, fewer components will be optimized, and vice versa. The default is `0.1`.
- `skip`: An array of identifiers that indicate a component should be skipped. You can put hook names, variable names, etc. The default is `[]`.

```js
const options = {
  auto: {
    threshold: 0.25, // default: 0.1,
    skip: ['useBadHook', /badVariable/g] // default []
  }
}
```


If you were using <a className="font-normal text-base" href='https://vitejs.dev/guide/'>Vite</a> for example and were trying to set up additional options for more features other than the default gotten from <a className="font-normal text-base" href="/docs/install">Installation</a>, you 
add the `auto` options object as follows:

```js
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [million.vite({ auto: true }, auto: {
    threshold: 0.25, // default: 0.1,
    skip: ['useBadHook', /badVariable/g] // default []
}), react()],
});
```


### Ignoring components

If a certain component conflicts with the Million.js runtime, it's possible to skip over them via the `// million-ignore` comment.

```js
// million-ignore
function App() {
  return ...
}
```



### Muting help messages

If you don't want to see the help messages, you can pass the `{ mute: true }{:js}` option to the compiler.
