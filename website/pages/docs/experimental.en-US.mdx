# Experimental Options

Million.js tries to experiment with different features by having experimental flags. This ensures that users have a good experience with those features before delivering them as stable features. 

Another reason for experimental options is to see if a certain feature is deliverable in a complete package. 

## No `<slot />` 

Million.js wraps blocks and their reactive props (portals) with `<slot />` tags so that it gets full control over the rendering! 

In the case of props, each block has no responsibility over the props it takes since they come from a different source. What it does in this case is that it wraps those props with `<slot />` and passes the rendering of those props to React.js. It should be noted that this does not apply to any prop.   

This experimental flag tries to achieve the removal of slots so that users would not be bothered with unexpected broken styles and `<slot />` elements.

### `block`

> For now, only blocks are supported in `noSlot` mode. Props are yet to be supported.

For [auto](/docs/automatic) mode, `noSlot` mode can be activated simply by adding this to your entry file:


```js
import { experimental_options } from 'million/experimental';

experimental_options.noSlot = true
// now `noSlot` mode is activated across your application  

function Lion() {
  return <img src="https://million.dev/lion.svg" />;
}
``` 

You can also pass the `experimental_noSlot` to the block function which is useful for manual mode.

```js
import { block } from 'million/react';
 
const LionBlock = block(
  function Lion() {
    return <img src="https://million.dev/lion.svg" />;
  },
  { experimental_noSlot: true },
);	
```

<Callout type="warning">
`noSlot` blocks do not support having siblings in their parents because handling non-block elements and elements that Million.js does not have any control over is challenging.

```jsx
<div>
  <span>first child</span>
  <LionBlock /> {/* ‚ùå Wrong */}
</div>

// üëáüëáüëá

<div>
  <span>first child</span>
  <div>
    <LionBlock /> {/* ‚úÖ Correct */}
  </div>
</div>
```
