# `<For>{:jsx}`

**Syntax:** `<For each={array}>{(item, index) => Block}</For>{:jsx}`\
**Example:** `<For each={[1, 2, 3]}>{(item) => myBlock({ item })}</For>{:jsx}`

The `<For />{:jsx}` component is used to render a list of blocks. It takes an array as the `each` prop and a function as its children. The function is called for each item in the array and is passed the item and its index as arguments.

It's the best way to loop over an array. As the array changes, `<For />{:jsx}` updates or moves items in the DOM rather than recreating them. Let's look at an example:

```jsx
import { block } from 'million/react';

function App() {
  const [items, setItems] = useState([1, 2, 3]);

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setItems([...items, items.length + 1])}>
        Add item
      </button>
      <ul>
        <For each={items}>{(item) => <li>{item}</li>}</For>
      </ul>
    </>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Optimizing `<For />`

Internally, `<For />` will not reuse blocks in order to avoid unknown behavior. This means that if you have a `<For />` with 1000 items, it will rereate 1000 blocks.

However, if you know that your items aren't dependent on any values except the `item` passed to the function, you can use the `memo` prop to tell Million to reuse blocks. This will improve performance and reduce memory usage.

```jsx
<For each={items} memo>
  {(item) => <li>{item}</li>}
</For>
```
