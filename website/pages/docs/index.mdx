# Introduction

**Million.js** is a fast and lightweight (`<4kb`) virtual DOM that can improve [React's speed by up to 70%](https://krausest.github.io/js-framework-benchmark/current.html).
With a fine-tuned, optimized virtual DOM, Million.js can have your React components running at the speed of raw JavaScript.

## Setup in seconds

The Million.js CLI will automatically install the package and configure your project for you.

<Tabs items={['npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn', 'bun']} storageKey="selected-manager">
  {/* prettier-ignore */}
  <Tab>
  ```bash copy
  npx million@latest
  ```
  </Tab>
  {/* prettier-ignore */}
  <Tab>
  ```bash copy
  pnpx million@latest
  ```
  </Tab>
  {/* prettier-ignore */}
  <Tab>
  ```bash copy
  yarn add million@latest
  ```
  </Tab>
  {/* prettier-ignore */}
  <Tab>
  ```bash copy
  bunx million@latest
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="info">
  Million.js is compatible with React 16 and above. If you're using an older
  version of React, you'll need to upgrade first.
</Callout>

That's it! Your project is now running on Million.js ðŸŽ‰
