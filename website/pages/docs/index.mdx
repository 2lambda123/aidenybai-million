# Introduction

**Million.js** is a fast and lightweight (`<4kb`) virtual DOM that can improve [React's speed by up to 70%](https://krausest.github.io/js-framework-benchmark/current.html).
With a fine-tuned, optimized virtual DOM, Million.js can have your React components running at the speed of raw JavaScript.

Million.js is compatible with React 16 and above. If you're using an older
version of React, you'll need to upgrade first.

The [Installation Guide](/docs/getting-started/install) can help you get started right away.

## Million.js vs. React

The following is a comprehensive demo using [key-based
rendering](https://react.dev/learn/rendering-lists#keeping-list-items-in-order-with-key)
to show how Million.js performance compares to React.
