# Introduction

**Million.js** is an extremely fast and lightweight `<4kb` virtual DOM that makes React up to [70% faster](https://krausest.github.io/js-framework-benchmark/current.html). By using a fine-tuned, optimized virtual DOM, Million.js reduces the overhead of React.

Imagine React components running at the speed of raw JavaScript.

**Million.js** makes your React applications faster automatically with auto-mode ([Automatic mode](/docs/automatic)) enabled. Enabling auto-mode is really easy to do, you just set up the Million compiler to handle optimizations
automatically with literally one parameter, checkout [Automatic Mode](/docs/install#configure-it-yourself) to set up Million.js in your project or just check out the [Installation Guide](/docs/install).

## Million.js vs. React

  The following is a comprehensive demo using [key-based
  rendering](https://react.dev/learn/rendering-lists#keeping-list-items-in-order-with-key)
  to show how Million.js performance compares to React.
