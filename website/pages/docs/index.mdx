# Million.js

**Million.js** is a framework that allows you to create a faster and more powerful virtual **DOM** (Document Object Model) for React. It is less than 4kb making it lightweight. And it makes React up to [70% faster](https://krausest.github.io/js-framework-benchmark/current.html). You can [try it out here](https://demo.million.dev) if you don't believe.

## So what is a virtual DOM?

For those of you who don't know, a virtual DOM a representation of JavaScript's DOM. It is lightweight, and helps frameworks like React and Vue with rendering elements to the frontend. Manipulating a virtual DOM is faster than manipulating the actual DOM because there is no direct access or changes made to the actual DOM.

{/* I'm commenting this out for now. In my opinion, it is more confusing to leave this here when there's no information about this yet.


## Configure your mode ⚠️

Million.js offers two modes of operation: **Automatic** and **Manual**. Automatic mode is the default and is the easiest to use. Manual mode is more complex, but offers more control and flexibility.

<Tabs items={['Automatic', 'Manual']} storageKey="mode">
  <Tab>You are using: **Automatic Mode**</Tab>
  <Tab>You are using: **Manual Mode**</Tab>
</Tabs> */}
