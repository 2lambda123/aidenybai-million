# Introduction

**Million.js** is a fast and lightweight (`<4kb`) virtual DOM that can improve [React's speed by up to 70%](https://krausest.github.io/js-framework-benchmark/current.html).
With a fine-tuned, optimized virtual DOM, Million.js can have your React components running at the speed of raw JavaScript.

With [Automatic Mode](/docs/automatic) enabled, Million.js can make your React applications faster without the need for manual intervention. 
Enabling auto-mode is simple: [configure the Million compiler](/docs/install#configure-it-yourself) to manage optimizations using just one parameter.

The [Installation Guide](/docs/install) can help you get started right away.
