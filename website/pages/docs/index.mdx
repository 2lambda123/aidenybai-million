# Introduction

**Million.js** is a fast and lightweight `<4kb` virtual DOM that makes React up to [70% faster](https://krausest.github.io/js-framework-benchmark/current.html). By using a fine-tuned, optimized virtual DOM, Million.js reduces the overhead of React; Imagine React components running at the speed of raw JavaScript.

**Million.js** can make your React applications faster with [Automatic Mode](/docs/automatic) enabled. Enabling auto-mode is simple - set up the Million compiler to handle optimizations automatically with just one parameter.

The [Installation Guide](/docs/install) can help you get started right away.
