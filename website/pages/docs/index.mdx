# Million.js

Million.js is a drop-in performance optimization for [React](https://reactjs.org).

with a lightweight (`<1kb`) Virtual DOM. It's [_**really fast**_](https://millionjs.org/benchmarks) and makes it easy to create user interfaces.

> Oh man... Another [`/virtual dom|javascript/gi`](https://regexr.com/6mr5f) library? I'm fine with [React](https://reactjs.org) already, why should I need it?

```jsx {2,12}
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
import { optimize } from 'million/react';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

const OptimizedApp = optimize(App); // yep, that's it!

createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(<OptimizedApp />);
```

Million makes creating user interfaces as easy as [React](https://reactjs.org), but with faster performance and smaller bundle size for the end user. By computing the user interface beforehand with a compiler, Million reduces the overhead of traditional Virtual DOM.

> Okay cool... but why should I use Million if I can just use [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) if I need something a bit more lightweight?

While alternative libraries like [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) reduce bundle sizes by efficient code design, Million takes it a step further by **leveraging compilation** to make a quantum leap in improving bundle size **and** render speed.

Think of it as if [React](https://preactjs.com/)'s API and [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)'s compiler had a baby. [A baby with _**super speed! ðŸ‘¶ðŸš€**_](https://millionjs.org/benchmarks)

  Thank you to GÃ©ry pioneering the concept of "blocks" in the virtual DOM. Many parts of the Million.js codebase either directly or indirectly derive from his work.
