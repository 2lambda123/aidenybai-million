# Million.js

**Million.js** is an extremely fast and lightweight `<4kb` virtual DOM that makes [React](https://react.dev) up to [70% faster](https://krausest.github.io/js-framework-benchmark/current.html). By using a fine-tuned, optimized virtual DOM, Million.js reduces the overhead of React. [Try it out here](https://demo.million.dev).

Imagine React components running at the speed of raw JavaScript.

## Configure your mode ⚠️

Million.js offers two modes of operation: **Automatic** and **Manual**. Automatic mode is the default and is the easiest to use. Manual mode is more complex, but offers more control and flexibility.

<Tabs items={['Automatic', 'Manual']} storageKey="mode">
  <Tab>You are using: **Automatic Mode**</Tab>
  <Tab>You are using: **Manual Mode**</Tab>
</Tabs>
