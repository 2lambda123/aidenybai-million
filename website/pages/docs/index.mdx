# What is Million.js?

Million.js is a drop-in performance optimization for [React](https://reactjs.org). It's a lightweight (`<4kb`) Virtual DOM that runs [_**really fast**_](https://krausest.github.io/js-framework-benchmark).

TL;DR - [React](https://preactjs.com/) components at the speed of raw JavaScript.

## Acknowledgements

- [`blockdom`](https://github.com/ged-odoo/blockdom) ([Géry Debongnie](https://github.com/ged-odoo))
  Thank you to Géry pioneering the concept of "blocks" in the virtual DOM. Many parts of the Million.js codebase either directly or indirectly derive from his work.

- [`voby`](https://github.com/vobyjs/voby) ([Fabio Spampinato](https://github.com/fabiospampinato))
  The Million.js "template" concept is derived from Voby's `template()` API.

- [`bun`](https://bun.sh) for their homepage. The Million.js homepage is a remix of what they have currently.

- [`ivi`](https://github.com/localvoid/ivi), [Preact](https://github.com/preactjs/preact), [and more](https://krausest.github.io/js-framework-benchmark/2021/table_chrome_96.0.4664.45.html)
