# Million.js

Million.js is a drop-in performance optimization for [React](https://reactjs.org). It's lightweight (`<4kb`) Virtual DOM and runs [_**really fast**_](https://krausest.github.io/js-framework-benchmark).

> Oh man... Another [`/virtual dom|javascript/gi`](https://regexr.com/6mr5f) library? I'm fine with [React](https://reactjs.org) already, why should I need it?

Million makes creating user interfaces as easy (It's just [React](https://reactjs.org)!), but with faster rendering and loading speeds. By using a fine-tuned, optimized virtual DOM, Million.js reduces the overhead of the React Reconciler.

> Okay cool... but why should I use Million.js if I can just use [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) if I need something a bit more lightweight?

While alternative libraries like [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) reduce bundle sizes via efficient code design, Million.js can be used inside [React](https://reactjs.org) and is much faster than Preact.

TL;DR - [React](https://preactjs.com/) components at the speed of raw JavaScript.

  Thank you to Géry pioneering the concept of "blocks" in the virtual DOM. Many parts of the Million.js codebase either directly or indirectly derive from his work.

  The Million.js "template" concept is derived from Voby's `template()` API.
