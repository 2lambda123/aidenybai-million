# Million.js

Million.js is a drop-in performance optimization for [React](https://reactjs.org). It's lightweight (`<4kb`) Virtual DOM and runs [_**really fast**_](https://krausest.github.io/js-framework-benchmark).

> Oh man... Another [`/virtual dom|javascript/gi`](https://regexr.com/6mr5f) library? I'm fine with [React](https://reactjs.org) already, why should I need it?

Million makes creating user interfaces as easy as [React](https://reactjs.org), but with faster performance and smaller bundle size for the end user. By computing the user interface beforehand with a compiler, Million reduces the overhead of traditional Virtual DOM.

> Okay cool... but why should I use Million if I can just use [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) if I need something a bit more lightweight?

While alternative libraries like [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) reduce bundle sizes by efficient code design, Million takes it a step further by **leveraging compilation** to make a quantum leap in improving bundle size **and** render speed.

Think of it as if [React](https://preactjs.com/)'s API and [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)'s compiler had a baby. [A baby with _**super speed! ðŸ‘¶ðŸš€**_](https://millionjs.org/benchmarks)

  Thank you to GÃ©ry pioneering the concept of "blocks" in the virtual DOM. Many parts of the Million.js codebase either directly or indirectly derive from his work.

  The Million.js "template" concept is derived from Voby's `template()` API.
