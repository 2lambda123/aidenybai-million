# Introduction

**Million.js** is an extremely fast and lightweight `<4kb` virtual DOM that makes React up to [70% faster](https://krausest.github.io/js-framework-benchmark/current.html). By using a fine-tuned, optimized virtual DOM, Million.js reduces the overhead of React.

Imagine React components running at the speed of raw JavaScript.
