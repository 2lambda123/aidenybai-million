<div>
  <CommonErrorVideo />
</div>

The above video happens to be an error raised by someone that wanted to integrate Million into their project.

## MobX Errors

"One of the biggest things in mobx 6 was that they removed decorators "Due to standardized JavaScript limitations 
in how class fields are constructed, it is no longer possible for MobX to alter the behavior of class fields by means of decorators or the decorate utility. 
Instead, fields have to be made observable by the constructor." - [Nobert Torok](https://github.com/norbertorok92)

### Solution To MobX Error

<Callout type="info">
 When using MobX, it is advisable to upgrade to V6 and remove decorators
