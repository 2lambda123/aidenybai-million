# Usage with Typescript

If your project uses TypeScript, you may want to make your components type-safe. Similar to React's `FC<Props>{:jsx}`, Million.js allows you to pass a generic into `block<Props>(){:jsx}`.

<Callout type="warning">
  You must make your Props use `type` instead of `interface`, as this is the
  [officially recognized
  behavior](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/15300#issuecomment-332366024)
  by the Typescript team.
</Callout>

```jsx
type Props = {
  name: string,
};

const MyComponent: React.FC<Props> = ({ name }) => {
  return <div>Hello {name}</div>;
};
const MyBlock = block < Props > MyComponent;
```
