# How To Use Typescript

Welcome to the Million.js documentation for the Typescript users. Let's learn how we can integrate Million.js into our React Typescript projects.

Million.js assumes that you're already familiar with and you're using React Typescript. If you're not, we recommend checking out [react.dev](https://react.dev/) first.

 How to use `block(){:jsx}` in the appropriate way with Typescript

## How do I use it in my React Typescript?

When working with React Typescript, it's important to remember that there are type information for props that
we need to pay attention to (remember that the way React works is with a funnel that passes data from some part of your app to another), and yes we don't want you just using `any` everywhere in your codebase. In here, you'll be shown
how you can use `block()` when working with Typescript.

To illustrate this, consider a scenario where you have some `MyComponent` component that takes in props from it's parent 
component `Parent` and ypu want it to be such that you render a list of strings called `names` that is passed down from the parent to `MyComponent` and of course,
we'll be using `<For/>` for optimized rendering.

Here's how to do it:

- Specify the typing information for your Props (using either `type` or `interface`)
- Type-cast your component and your block with the aforementioned typing information


In the case of the above scenario, here's what it'll look like:

```jsx
type Props = {
  name: string;
};

const MyComponent: React.FC<Props> = ({ name }) => {
  return <div>Hello {name}</div>;
};

const MyBlock = block<Props>(MyComponent);

const Parent = () => {
  const names = ['John', 'Jane', 'Joe'];

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Name will now be recognized as a string instead of any type, TypeScript will also know that MyBlock takes in a name prop */}
      <For each={names}>{(name) => <MyBlock name={name} />}</For>
    </div>
  );
};
```
