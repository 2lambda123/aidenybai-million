# Automatic Mode

Million.js comes with Automatic Mode as its default setting. This transforms your React components into Million.js components, improving speed without any major code changes.

When [installing Million into your project](/docs/install), automatic mode is recommended for most users and this is because it packs in it all the necessary optimizations that your application needs. The `auto` option of the compiler toggles it.

### `auto`

The `auto` option is a boolean that enables automatic mode. By default it is unset, because Million offers [a way to manually set your configuration](/docs/install#configure-it-yourself).
