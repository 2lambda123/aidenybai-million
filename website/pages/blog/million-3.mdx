# Announcing Million 3

After many months of development (_and one [soft launch](https://twitter.com/aidenybai/status/1732812329434423647) later_), we're **so excited** to finally release Million 3. Many hundreds of hours have gone into this release by the Million community, including the core team, contributors, and many Discord members who have helped us test and provide feedback.

## What is Million?

Million.js is an optimizing compiler for React. Traditionally, React uses the virtual DOM, which often makes the browser do lots of extra work to compute DOM operations. As your website grows, this can lead to sluggish load and render times.

Instead, Million.js compiles down your React components a custom runtime. This results in much [faster reconciliation](https://million.dev/docs), allowing you to write very data heavy user interfaces without sacrificing performance.

Million 1 & 2 were experiments to see whether it was possible to use a compiler to make React faster ‚Äì we were blown away by the results. Million 3 is a stability upgrade to make the developer experience even better.

Million 3 is a complete rewrite of the compiler. The team has been dead set on maximizing compatibility with the React ecosystem, while also providing a more efficient and faster runtime. Just upgrade to see what we mean ‚Äì significantly faster user experience with no changes to your codebase.

## What's new

### Performance

In old Million, hydration was coarse. When a component is SSRed, hydration occurs, and the entire component is hydrated. This is slow and inefficient, especially as your React app gets larger.

In Million 3, we've introduced a new hydration system that only hydrates the parts of the component that need it. This means that your components will hydrate much faster, and your users will see a much faster time-to-interactive.

Here's a comparison:

<Tabs items={['Old', 'New (Million 3)']}>
<Tab>
Normally, React SSR will hydrate the entire component (üëé ‚ùå)

```jsx {1-4}
<div>
  <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
  <button onClick={handleClick}>{count}</button>
</div>
```
</Tab>

<Tab>
Million 3 only hydrates `handleClick` and `count` (‚ú® ‚úÖ)

```jsx /\{count\}/ /\{handleClick\}/
<div>
  <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
  <button onClick={handleClick}>{count}</button>
</div>
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Stability

Million 3 is a complete rewrite of the compiler. We've taken the time to re-architect the compiler to be more stable, more predictable, and more maintainable. This means that you can expect fewer bugs, better error messages, and a more consistent developer experience.

Among these changes are: better TypeScript support, better import inference, multiple return and conditional support, and better portal handling.

In the next few minor releases, we will be focusing on improving the performance of the compiler, reducing time to build.

### Docs & i18n upgrade

The official [million.dev](https://million.dev) site has gotten an overhaul. We've added a new i18n system, so the site is now available in multiple languages! The documentation has been reorganized to show automatic mode as the default, and manual mode as an advanced feature.

## Upgrading to version 3

Your current 2.x.x code should work with 3.x.x with no changes. To upgrade, simply run:

```bash
npx million@latest
```

That's all!

## The road ahead

The future of Million is to be the de-facto performance toolset for the web. In the coming weeks, the Million team will ship a suite of developer tools to redefine how frontend engineering teams approach <span className="underline decoration-wavy text-amber-500 decoration-amber-600">debugging</span>, fixing, and maintaining web performance.

Today, dealing with performance issues is a nightmare. The status quo is navigating through React Devtools, `Profiler`, Chrome Devtools, `why-did-you-render`, Forget, and the lot. This is a fundamentally broken experience ‚Äì causing months of wasted developer productivity, and millions of dollars in lost revenue.

Even traditional players, like Next.js, who attempt to innovate on the front by providing better developer experience and performance fail at a fundamentally simple idea ‚Äì not everyone uses a React framework.

At Million, we have a simple thesis for the web ‚Äì we can build tools that can make existing tooling fast and easy to use. Developers should think only of shipping features and fixing bugs ‚Äì not of performance. We plan to start with React, then extend to backend, mobile, and other platforms.

I extend an [open invitation](mailto:aiden@million.dev) to join us in this journey. Because ultimately, we're just getting started.
