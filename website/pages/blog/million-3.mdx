After many months of development (_and one [soft launch](https://twitter.com/aidenybai/status/1732812329434423647) later_), we're **so excited** to _finally_ release Million 3.0!

Even though we're changing how things work under the hood, Million 3.0 should be a drop-in replacement for everyone. You can upgrade to the latest version without any code changes.

If you haven't tried Million.js yet, you can [check out the documentation](/docs/quickstart) to get started.

## Migrating to v3.0.0

Adding Million to a React project?

```bash
npx million@latest
```

Want to upgrade from 2.x to 3.0?

```bash
npm install million@latest
```

## What's new?

## Million Wrapped

// TODO: Mohammad add some stuff here, ill clean it up

## Million Copilot

AI powered React performance linter

### Better compiler

#### Consistent import macro

```js
import { block } from 'million/react';

// or

import { block as millionBlock } from 'million/react';

// or

import * as million from 'million/react';
```

#### Automatic block name generation

// TODO showcase name generation

#### Composition

// TODO explain how new compiler handles block components

#### Portal Support

// TODO explain how new compiler handles portals

#### TypeScript

// TODO explain how new compiler understands TypeScript syntax

### Faster runtime

// TODO: Mohammad

## The road ahead

The future of Million.js is to be the de-facto performance toolset for the web. In the coming weeks, we'll be shipping some extremely powerful and novel tools to help you build faster websites.

Along with the new features, we'll be shipping a new website and documentation to help you get started. We'll also be shipping a new kitchen sink to show off some of the new features.
