After many months of development (_and one [soft launch](https://twitter.com/aidenybai/status/1732812329434423647) later_), we're **so excited** to finally release Million 3. Many hundreds of hours have gone into this release by the Million community, including the core team, contributors, and many Discord members who have helped us test and provide feedback.

## What's new

### Performance

In old Million, hydration was coarse.


### Stability

better TypeScript support
better macro inference (you can now do import `{ block as someBlock }` or million.block
automatic displayName generation
better portal handling and code output
support for code branching in block

## Million Linter

## Upgrading to version 3

Your current 2.x.x code should work with 3.x.x with no changes. To upgrade, simply run:

```bash
npx million@latest
```

## The road ahead


## Acknowledgements

Thank you

First and foremost, thank you to all of the many Svelte maintainers and contributors who made this release possible. Developers contributing multiple PRs to this release were @dummdidumm, @gtm-nayan, @benmccann, @tanhauhau, @Karlinator, and @ngtr6788. Also, thank you to the many community members who donated to the Svelte OpenCollective - these donations sponsored the site overhaul completed by PuruVJ as well as a number of recent fixes from @gtm-nayan.

Finally, thank you to the various library maintainers from across the ecosystem who helped prepare for this release. Thank you to @jessebeach for the help in getting out new versions of aria-query and axobject-query, @jreinhold for ensuring compatibility with Storybook, and @yanick for updating svelte-testing-library. And to ensure things stay working, the svelte-ecosystem-ci setup by @dominikg — which was modeled off his similar work for Vite — has been helping to test against major projects in the ecosystem on an ongoing basis.
