title: Million Lint is now 1.0

description: We are getting closer!

Let’s make the web fast.

Two months ago, we announced [*Million Lint is in public beta*]. After 11,000+ beta testers (_thank you!_) and bugs, we are so excited to announce Million Lint 1.0.0-rc.0.

The product is generally stable, with no anticipated breaking changes between now and stable release.

If you’ve been waiting to explore since the public beta, you should definitely try it out. You can get started on any React project like so:

```jsx
npx @million/install@latest
```

## Profilers are pure overhead

We started Million Lint to see if we could solve unnecessary re-renders in React without flamegraphs (traditionally used by React/Chrome profiler). We were tired of the enormous amount of data to process to debug a single performance problem.

Think a grid of product tiles, search inputs, or passing functions and objects through props. It’s painful to dig through the thousands of randomly colored rectangles with obscure function names. We try to skip over the unnecessary information, then we try to figure out what causes the problem. It’s never ending – Why is this happening? What triggered this issue? How did I fix it? Did I even catch the performance error? Maybe I should ask ChatGPT. It’s telling me to memoize everything? Or apparently I shouldn’t do that?

Suddenly, 8 hours has gone by and you haven’t figured out the bottleneck – or the 100 other tasks in your backlog. You know this is bad for users, but you have no choice but to frustratingly give up.

The idea was – what if we profiled the application automatically? External dev tools is no longer necessary, and Million Lint could just put the data in the IDE.

Five months later, there’s no more guessing or tedious data sifting. Renders are displayed inline to your code. It takes seconds to find issues, and minutes to solve them. Not only do you spend less time profiling, there’s simply less data to reason about when developing your website.

## Profilers are an implementation detail

Our core thesis is if we abstract away the profiler, we can enable developers to find and solve 80% of performance issues for 20% of the original effort.

Want to know how many times a hook changed? Data is no longer hidden away in timeline spans, just see it alongside your code.

What if I want full visibility and check the performance at a specific moment in time?

[interactions, replay]

This is a small peek into what Million Lint enables you to do.

## Profiler guided optimization

There are a couple approaches in this space: runtime profilers tools and pure compilers (React Compiler). Both have limitations. Profilers require source maps and traversing over React fibers, which may add extra overhead that could slow down your app. Compilers add overhead on build time, and don’t have runtime metrics.

Million Lint uses a combination of both – and we display that data in your IDE.

We cover this in more detail in our [public beta announcement].

## Profilers in production

Most performance issues are caught in production. For example, a developer may load just a few rows of test data, but a user could potentially load thousands. Much of this data is lost and never fixed. We realized we had to deploy Million Lint in production for it to catch more issues.

But we couldn’t yet. Million Lint at public beta (2 months ago) was a whopping 69kB gzip at runtime. For comparison, `@sentry/web` is X kb. Not to mention it totaled nearly 69% of JS execution time.

So, we rewrote Million Lint from ground up. Originally, we assembled all of the data into a single source of truth.

We realized we were unnecessarily duplicating the same data across the client and IDE. So, instead, we sent the data from the client and compiler to the IDE.

[image of client + compiler ⇒ vscode, de-duplicated as vscode single source of truth]

This optimized our build from 69 kb gzip to {"<"}4 kb gzip, and 69% of JS execution to under 0.5%.

One customer worked with for the past 2 months is Faire, a large eCommerce company. 25% of their users have to wait 5s+ for their page to load.

With the new Million Lint, we were able to ~10kb gzip transported every 5 minutes on Faire. A huge decrease. We’ll have more information about them soon.

## What’s next

We encourage you to try out 1.0-rc in your React codebase. Following the RC phase, we’ll be continuing efforts to stabilize automatic issue detection and code fixing.

Soon, you’ll be able to debug errors inside of …
